<h1>US House Of Representatives Project</h1>

<h2>Description:</h2>

This project explores how rising expenditures by the U.S. House of Representatives correlate with broader economic challenges, including median family income and employment trends. By analyzing House Disbursement Data alongside U.S. Census API data, I investigated how taxpayer dollars are spent, which categories are driving cost increases, and how these patterns may contribute to inflationary pressure on American households.

<h2>Tools & Technologies:</h2>

- Python (Pandas, Altair, Matplotlib)
- Jupyter Notebook
- US House Dispersement Reports
- US Census Beareu API
- Data cleaning, trend analysis, visualization
